# Leros LLVM/Clang Integration

This repository contains the LLVM/Clang backend and related infrastructure for the [Leros](https://leros-dev.github.io/) processor architecture.

## ⚠️ Project Status: Broken

**This repository is currently broken and not usable. Two major issues must be fixed:**

### 1. Missing definitions and methods

This repository is missing overloaded methods and overloaded functions for LLVM20+.

### 2. Outdated Leros Clang Codebase

The entire Leros-specific Clang codebase is outdated and requires a careful update to be compatible with modern LLVM/Clang releases.
